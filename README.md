# Hellooo, It's PndaBoi Here!

### This Is A Python Program To Showcase Two Modules (Gratient And Fade).

### I Really Like Both Of These Modules So I Decided To Write A Program Which Prints Out All Of The Color Themes Of Faded And Gradient!

### Both Modules Are Made By [@venaxyt] -> https://github.com/venaxyt/

https://github.com/venaxyt/gratient | https://pypi.org/project/gratient | pip install gratient

https://github.com/venaxyt/fade | https://pypi.org/project/fade | pip install fade

This took some time so motivate me to do more like this by giving it a star ðŸ˜„
